# Javascript Concepts #1 Throttling
This small project contains a simple HTML and Javascript file.

A quick example:  You have a resize listener on the window which does some element dimension calculations and (possibly)  repositions a few elements.  That isn't a heavy task in itself but being repeatedly fired after numerous resizes will really slow your site down.

Another example: In any web site where the any button is there, whicjh going to perform some. API calls. so if click if we are going to call API then then lot of traffic will generate.So here we need to introduce the Throttling concept to make user experiance flawless.
